      <h1>Who Am I?</h1> 

      Hi, I’m Jhamiya Jones, a dedicated professional from Atlanta, Georgia, with a passion for growth, creativity, and problem-solving.
       Above all, I am a proud mother to a beautiful daughter, who inspires me every day to strive for balance, excellence, and self-care in all aspects of life. 
       Family is at the core of everything I do, and I firmly believe that maintaining a sense of harmony between personal and professional ambitions is essential for long-term success.
      
      My background is deeply rooted in human development, education, and organization. 
      With a Bachelor of Science in Human Development and Family Sciences from the University of Georgia, I have cultivated a strong foundation in understanding people, problem-solving, and adaptability. 
      Throughout my career, I have gained experience in childcare, special education, case management, customer service, and operational support—skills that have shaped my ability to work efficiently, think critically, and communicate effectively.
      
      Now, I am expanding my expertise into the world of technology, with a focus on software engineering. 
      I have beginner experience in HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and wireframing, and I am eager to continue developing my skills in web development and programming. 
      My ability to organize, analyze, and create user-friendly experiences makes me a strong candidate for the tech industry.
